    <h1>Welcome to KWI.</h1>
    <p>If you don't know what <span title="Kajiggy With It">KWI</span> is, this is an archive of kajigs (see <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Kajig">Kajig</a>) from the start of the TN kajigs forum channel to <b>August 24, 2024</b>. New kajigs after that date have NOT been archived. Furthermore, this list was compiled programatically and therefore may be missing crutial information found later within the specific forum posts (this just shows the first message, which usually contains all exploit details. In some cases there are more messages with info on the exploit so we will manually go through those and add more exploit details if deemed necessary).</p>
  
    <p>This site was made by Bromine35. We do NOT care about the following: bad titles (including outdated titles), patched exploits, poorly formatted exploit info, categorization of exploits. We DO care about: exploit pages without the full exploits, troll/useless posts that are better removed, broken pages.</p>
